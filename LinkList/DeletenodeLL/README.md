# Delete Node in a LinkList

## Problem
Write a function to __delete a node__ in a singly-linked list. You will __not__ be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to __the node to be deleted directly__.

*__Note__*:<br>
It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
